   This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css.
   Any CSS and SCSS (if SCSS is configured) file within this directory, 
   lib/assets/stylesheets, or vendor/assets/stylesheets can be referenced here using a relative path.

   You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
   compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
